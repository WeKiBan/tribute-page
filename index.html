        <li><strong>1946:</strong> Alan publishes a paper with the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.</li>
        <li><strong>1949:</strong> Alan is made deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University.s</li>
        <li><strong>1950:</strong> Alan publishes the famous paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1951:</strong> Alan is elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and also gives talks about Artificial Intelligence on the BBC.</li>
        <li><strong>1952:</strong> Alan is arrested for gross indecency. He loses his security clearance so he cannot work. He is offered chemical treatment instead of going to prison. The treatment makes him very unwell.</li>

        <li><strong>2009:</strong> Thousands of people sign a petition. The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown makes a public apology saying the treatment of Alan Turing was "appalling".</li>
